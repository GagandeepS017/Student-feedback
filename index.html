      <h2>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</h2>
      <p>I will write a paragraph for each methodology of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/">SDLC</a>. There are many of them but I will suggest a few suggestions and reasons are as follows</p>
      <div class="SDLC">
        <h3>Suggestions and Reasons:</h3>
        <ol class=" capitalAlphabet">
          <li><strong>Waterfall</strong> is the ideal approach when you have a clear, well-defined plan with fixed requirements, and when the project details are unlikely to change over time. It works best for projects with a structured, predictable flow, such as in construction and manufacturing, where the constraints and structure of the plan are well understood.</li>
          <li><strong>Agile</strong> works well for projects that are dynamic, where requirements change frequently such as software development, startups, and digital products where quick changes and customer feedback is essential for success. It allows flexibility, quicker iterations, and frequent adjustments. Any issues came across will be fixed and addressed quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>DevOps</strong> is ideal for teams looking to integrate development and operations to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery, making it essential for modern web services and apps where time to release in market and end dates are critical.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class = "SDLC">
        <p>Among so many SDLC Methodlogies the ones that are in the Agile classification are better. Among agile SDLC methods, I have also few suggestions.</p>
        <h3>Suggestions:</h3>
        <ol class="capitalAlphabet">
          <li><strong>Scrum</strong> is ideal for teams looking for an organized, iterative approach with regular updates, frequent feedback such as software or products that require fast delivery and frequent feedback. It maintains the hierarchy where everyone has their own responsibility. It helps in delivering high-quality products quickly while improving processes over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Kanban</strong> is well-suited for teams that need a flexible such as ongoing projects where the flow is unpredictable and visual approach to manage work without strict iterations, continuous delivery, and optimizing workflows which helps in minimizing the time.</li>
          <li><strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong> is an Agile methodology that focus on technical improvement and frequent communication with customers such as startups or product-driven companies focusing on high-quality, maintainable software. It's ideal for projects where the quality of code and responsiveness to customer needs are crucial.</li>
          <li><strong>Feature-Driven Development (FDD)</strong> as the name states it is best for larger projects that require clear, feature-based milestones and a structured yet flexible approach to development. It is suitable for teams that need to scale development while keeping a clear focus on delivering customer-oriented features.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In this Softwawre development and application course of <a href="https://www.srh-university.de/de/">SRH</a>. We learn the followings</p>
        <h3>Software Development Learnings:</h3>
        <ol class="alphabet">
          <li>Problem-solving skills.</li>
          <li>Collaboration and teamwork.</li>
          <li>Version control systems like Git.</li>

      <h2>Webpage Development Techniques</h2>
      <p>I have used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> in this webpage and there are 3 ways to include css in a webpage as follows</p>
      <div class="Webpage">
        <h3>Ways to Include CSS:</h3>
        <ol class="alphabet">
          <li>Inline CSS for specific elements.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS within the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS for consistent styling across multiple pages.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="Webpage">
        <h3>The reasons CSS Used in a webpage are:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Separation of concerns for easier maintenance.</li>
          <li>Reusable styling by making classes in division.</li>

        <h3>Usage of JavaScript:</h3>
        <ol class="alphabet">
          <li>Form validation to ensure proper input such as matriculation number, email validation and only alpha charaters in name fields.</li>
          <li>Dynamic content updates without reloading the page.</li>
          <li>Enhancing user experience with interactivity.</li>
